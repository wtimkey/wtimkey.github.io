Hello! I am a post-baccalaureate researcher in the [Computational Psycholingusitics Reserach Discussions group (C.Psyd)](https://c-psyd.github.io/) housed within the [Department of Lingusitics](https://linguistics.cornell.edu/) at [Cornell University](https://cornell.edu). I have the pleasure of being advised by [Marten van Schijndel](https://vansky.github.io/). I graduated with a degree in Linguistics from Cornell in May 2020, and I'm currently applying to PhD programs in Lingustics and Cognitive Science.

My research interestes lie broadly within the field of computational psycholingusitics, specifically:

**1) Inductive Biases:** What can statistical models of language, such as deep neural nets, teach us about what is learnable from primary lingusitic data with a general-purpose learner.

**2) Statistical Models as Theories of Human Langauge Processing:** There has been a considerable amount of research in recent years which seeks to evaluate the lingusitic knowledge encoded in state-of-the-art language models like BERT and GPT-2. These models may not only provide insights into what is learnable from finite lingusitic data, but also uncover potential theories of real-time language processing in humans.

## Teaching

I also have a passion for teaching! Currently, I am a Teaching Fellow in the [Department of Statisics](https://statistics.fas.harvard.edu/) at Harvard University. I believe a solid understanding of statistics is fundamental to good science in any field.
