Hello! I am a post-baccalaureate researcher in the [Computational Psycholingusitics Reserach Discussions group (C.Psyd)](https://c-psyd.github.io/) housed within the [Department of Lingusitics](https://linguistics.cornell.edu/) at [Cornell University](https://linguistics.cornelll.edu). I have the pleasure of being advised by [Marten van Schijndel](https://vansky.github.io/).

I also have a passion for teaching. Currently, I am a Teaching Fellow in the [Department of Statisics](https://statistics.fas.harvard.edu/) at Harvard University. I believe a solid understanding of statistics is fundamental to good science in any field.

My research interestes lie broadly within the field of computational psycholingusitics, and seek to address two main questions?
**1) Inductive Biases:** What can statistical models of language, such as deep neural nets, teach us about what is learnable from primary lingusitic data with a domain-general learner.

**2) Statistical Models as Theories of Human Langauge Processing** There has been a considerable amount of research in recent years which seeks to evaluate the lingusitic knowledge encoded in state-of-the-art language models like BERT and GPT-2. These models may not only provide insights into what is learnable from finite lingusitic data, but also uncover potential theories of human language processing.
